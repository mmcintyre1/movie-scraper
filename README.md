## Movie Scraper
The idea is to scrape all wikipedia's movie category items, then populate an actor list from each movie.  

This will be cleaned up and put in a database, and then fed into the 6 degrees of separation app I'll build out afterwards.  

This is leveraging the API documented here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

## Additional Thoughts
Once the titles are parsed, they might be able to be bumped up against IMDB's API, or OMDB's API, although the latter doesn't give nearly as full a cast list as wikipedia parsing.
